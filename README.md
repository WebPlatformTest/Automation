# Automation
Use BrowserStack and WebDriver to automatically generate test reports for HTML5test.com

This is a command line tool that is responsible for new browser reports ending up on HTML5test.com. Everyday this script should be run and it should do the following:

* Query BrowserStack for all browsers that are available.
* Query HTML5test for all reports that are generated by BrowserStack.
* See if there are new browsers available for which we do not have any results.
 
For each new browser browser it should do the following:

* Using an identier from BrowserStack get a Task from HTML5test
* Using WebDriver start a browser on BrowserStack 
* Load the URL we got from the task in the browser
* Poll HTML5test repeatedly (with a timeout) to see if we got any data
* If we did, show the score and print an URL to the test report.
